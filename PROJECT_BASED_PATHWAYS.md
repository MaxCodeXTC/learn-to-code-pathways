# PATHWAYS

The intent of these pathways is to a facilitate more practical learning by making it a project-based curriculum.
Basically, the curriculum will take a user through a series of 10 or so projects working towards mastery in a certain area, eg front-end development.
Then we, or the community of propelup.io can filter through the best learning material to be able to complete these projects.
